# Matching Engine

A matching engine built on the [LMAX architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html) in Rust.

- **Single-threaded matching engine** — no locks on the hot path; one thread executes all matching logic
- **LMAX disruptor pipeline** — 3 OS threads (journal, matching, response) on lock-free ring buffers; lock-free CAS-based multi-producer from reader pool; journal and matching run in parallel on the same events
- **Persist-before-ack** — pipelined journal I/O with full durability guarantee; matching latency overlapped against journal writes, acknowledgement gated on confirmed durability, not optimistically sent
- **Batch sync amortization** — under load, one sync covers many events; `pwritev2` with `RWF_DSYNC` (Force Unit Access) combines write + durability in a single syscall; `posix_fallocate` pre-allocates 64 MiB chunks so sync only flushes data pages, not extent metadata
- **Event sourcing** — deterministic replay for crash recovery and audit; snapshots for fast restart
- **Mechanical sympathy** — cache-line-padded sequences, fixed-point pricing (no floats), zero allocations on the hot path

## Features

Checklist of features expected of a production trade execution engine. Items marked with **[x]** are implemented; **[ ]** are planned; *deferred* items are not needed for the LAN benchmark demo.

- [x] Health checks / readiness probes (`ServerReady` wire handshake on connect)

### Metrics & Observability
- [x] Pipeline stage utilization (`pipeline-stats` feature gate — busy/idle ratio per stage)
- [ ] Metrics transport (decide where/how to expose: stats file, output event channel, admin socket)
- [ ] Connection counts, disruptor queue depth — *primary node only*
- [ ] Order/fill/cancel throughput, latency histograms, volume analytics — *deffered: replica or offline (journal-derived, zero primary impact)*

### Redundancy & High Availability
- [ ] Journal replication (WAL streaming to replica) — *deferred*
- [ ] State machine replication (deterministic replay on replica) — *deferred*
- [ ] Failover detection and promotion (leader election, split-brain prevention) — *deferred*
- [ ] Client failover (reconnect to new primary, resume with sequence numbers) — *deferred*

### Performance Tuning
- [x] Release profile: `lto = "fat"`, `codegen-units = 1`, `panic = "abort"`, `target-cpu=native`

## Performance

The [benchmark suite](crates/bench/) supports three modes: bare matching engine, disruptor pipeline without network, and full TCP/UDS round-trip. Results below are from the round-trip mode measuring full TCP loopback latency. AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D (8C/16T), 64 GB DDR5, NVMe SSD, Linux 6.8. All threads pinned to dedicated cores, IRQs pinned to core 0, CPU governor locked to performance.

All benchmarks: 10M order pairs, 16 clients, 64 pipelined orders per client.

**Without persistence** (pipeline + network ceiling):

```
sudo ./scripts/bench-isolate.sh --features io-uring,no-persist -- 10000000 --clients=16 --window=64

Throughput:  3.61M orders/sec (0.28 µs/order)
Latency:     p99 = 355 µs, p99.9 = 605 µs, max = 2.55 ms
```

**With fsync/FUA** (full durability, pwritev2 + RWF_DSYNC):

```
sudo ./scripts/bench-isolate.sh --features io-uring -- 10000000 --clients=16 --window=64

Throughput:  830K orders/sec (1.20 µs/order)
Latency:     p99 = 1.84 ms, p99.9 = 4.55 ms, max = 7.55 ms
```
