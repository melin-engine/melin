# Melin

Melin is a high-performance exchange core written in Rust on the [LMAX disruptor architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html), built for venues that cannot compromise on correctness, durability, or latency. It delivers over 5M orders/sec over LAN with synchronous replication and full fsync durability, with sub-100 µs p99.9 single-order latency, pipelining persistence with execution without cutting corners. Beyond order matching, Melin handles account management, risk controls, circuit breakers, fee schedules, authentication, journaling, and replication — everything an exchange needs between the network edge and the trading API.

## Scope

Melin is an exchange core: order matching, account management, risk controls, fee calculation, journaling, replication, and connection authentication. It handles everything between the network edge and the trading API. Gateway concerns such as market data fan-out, client session management, per-account rate limiting, account identity and authorization, FIX/ITCH protocol translation, are out of scope and handled by upstream services that consume Melin's output event channel.

## Why Melin

**Correct** — strict price-time priority verified by property-based tests across thousands of random order sequences; cross-validated against independent matching engine implementations and real market data to surface edge cases that single-engine testing misses; deterministic replay guarantees identical state from the same journal; balance conservation enforced by proptest invariants; fuzz testing covers journal and wire protocol decoding.

**Durable** — every order is persisted (pwritev2 + RWF_DSYNC) and replicated before acknowledgement; crash recovery via journal replay with CRC32C integrity checks; BLAKE3 hash chain for tamper evidence.

**Efficient** — single-threaded matching engine on a lock-free disruptor pipeline; journal and matching run in parallel; no allocations on the hot path; 8.1M orders/sec local fsync, 5.8M/sec with synchronous replication.

- **[LMAX-style disruptor pipeline](docs/pipeline-architecture.md)** — 3 OS threads (journal, matching, response) on lock-free ring buffers; lock-free CAS-based multi-producer from reader pool; journal and matching run in parallel on the same events
- **Batch sync amortization** — under load, one sync covers many events; `pwritev2` with `RWF_DSYNC` (Force Unit Access) combines write + durability in a single syscall; `posix_fallocate` pre-allocates 256 MiB chunks so sync only flushes data pages, not extent metadata
- **Mechanical sympathy** — cache-line-padded sequences, fixed-point pricing (no floats), pre-allocated buffers with no per-order allocations on the hot path
- **Pre-allocated everything** — reservation slab (2M slots), order book indices, and balance maps are pre-sized and page-faulted at startup; jemalloc avoids glibc fragmentation

## LAN Benchmarks

All numbers are **full round-trip** (client sends order → server journals to NVMe with fsync → matching engine executes → response arrives at client). Every order is durably persisted before acknowledgement. [Realistic order flow](crates/bench/src/generator.rs). Reproducible via `scripts/lan-bench-suite.sh`. For production deployment and OS tuning, see [operations](docs/operations.md) and [benchmarking](docs/benchmarking.md).

### Peak throughput (16 clients, window 256)

Kernel TCP over 10 Gbps private VLAN. Two or three Cherry AMD Ryzen 9 9950X servers (16C, SMT off, dedicated NVMe journal). Commit [`ed9241d`](../../commit/ed9241d).

| Durability | Throughput | p50 | p99 | p99.9 | max |
|------------|-----------|-----|-----|-------|-----|
| **Local fsync** | **8.1M/s** | 439 µs | 569 µs | 636 µs | 1,017 µs |
| **Synchronous replication** (fsync + replica ack) | **5.8M/s** | 633 µs | 841 µs | 933 µs | 1,123 µs |

### Single-order latency (1 client, window 1)

The latency floor — one order at a time, no pipelining, no queuing.

| Transport | p50 | p90 | p99 | max | Hardware |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|----------|
| Kernel TCP | 72 µs | 87 µs | 90 µs | 207 µs | Ryzen 9 9950X, 10 GbE |
| **DPDK kernel bypass** | **37 µs** | **38 µs** | **101 µs** | 1,775 µs | EPYC 4564P, Intel 82599 10 GbE SR-IOV |

The DPDK result is an early experimental measurement with end-to-end kernel bypass (both client and server) on budget server-class hardware — not purpose-built low-latency infrastructure and with SR-IOV (dedicated or bifurcated would be better). 47% p50 reduction vs kernel TCP on the same machines.

**Latency CDF** — peak-load modes on the same axes:

**Latency stability over time** (p99.99, replication mode):

![Latency stability — replication](docs/plots/latency-stability-replication.svg)

### Bottleneck and next steps

The TCP network stack is the primary throughput limiter. The journal pipeline hides fsync latency at high pipelining depths. DPDK kernel bypass (landed, experimental) halves single-order p50 latency; further transport tuning is the main remaining optimization vector.

## Features

### Order Types
- Market, Limit, Stop (stop-loss), Stop-Limit
- Time-in-force: GTC, IOC, FOK, Day, GTD (Good-Til-Date)
- Post-Only (maker-only, reject if would take)

### [Matching Engine](docs/matching-engine.md)
- Strict price-time priority (sorted Vec + binary search order book)
- Execution reports: Fill (with fees), Placed, Triggered, Cancelled, Rejected, Replaced, InstrumentStatusChanged
- Multi-instrument exchange with shared account balances
- Cancel-replace / order amendment (atomic price/qty modify; preserves queue priority when price unchanged, loses priority on price change)
- Circuit breakers (price bands, trading halts — per-instrument `CircuitBreakerConfig`)
- Instrument lifecycle management (disable/enable/remove — disable cancels all resting orders atomically, remove reclaims memory)

### [Fees](docs/fee-model.md)
- Maker/taker fee model (per-instrument `FeeSchedule` in basis points, configurable via admin API)
- Fee deduction on fill (fees in quote currency, deducted from buyer reservation and seller proceeds, reported in `ExecutionReport::Fill`)
- Collected fees credited to a dedicated fee account — operators can withdraw via admin API; balance conservation enforced across all accounts

### [Risk & Accounting](docs/risk-checks.md)
- Per-account, per-currency balance management (reserve on order, update on fill, release on cancel)
- Self-trade prevention (per-order modes: CancelNewest, CancelOldest, CancelBoth)
- Fat finger checks (max order size, max notional value — per-instrument configurable `RiskLimits`)
- Kill switch (cancel all resting orders and pending stops for an account across all instruments)
- Per-account OrderId high-water mark (prevents double-execution on crash-recovery retry)
- Price band checks (static lower/upper bounds, per-instrument — part of circuit breaker config)
- Withdraw event (debit funds, auto-evict zero-balance entries)

### [Event Sourcing & Durability](docs/journal.md)
- Write-ahead journal with CRC32C checksums and BLAKE3 hash chain (tamper evidence, replica consistency)
- Persist-before-ack: matching latency overlapped against journal writes, acknowledgement gated on confirmed durability
- Batch journal I/O via LMAX disruptor ring buffer pipeline (`pwritev2` + `RWF_DSYNC`)
- Pre-allocated storage (`posix_fallocate`) for reduced fsync latency
- Snapshot save/load for fast recovery; journal rotation (automatic snapshot + archive when size threshold exceeded)
- Deterministic replay from journal for crash recovery and audit
- Scheduled snapshots via shadow exchange — periodic snapshots on a dedicated thread without pausing the matching engine (`--snapshot-interval-secs`)

### [Replication & High Availability](docs/replication.md)
- Synchronous dual replication — live WAL streaming to 2 replicas via lock-free ring buffer; replicas fsync and ack before the primary sends responses to clients (zero acknowledged data loss)
- Journal catch-up — new replicas automatically catch up from the primary's journal files before switching to live streaming; enables replica replacement with zero downtime
- Automatic trading halt when all replicas disconnect — trading continues with at least one replica; resumes instantly on reconnect
- Manual promotion — operator sends `PROMOTE` to the replica's trigger endpoint; in-process transition reuses the warm Exchange state with zero re-replay, sub-second switchover
- Multi-process failover tests — SIGKILL primary under load, promote replica, verify no data loss and clients can reconnect

### [Networking](docs/wire-protocol.md)
- Custom binary wire protocol (length-prefixed framing)
- TCP, Unix domain socket, and DPDK kernel bypass transports
- Epoll reader pool (edge-triggered, non-blocking) with dedicated I/O threads (zero tokio)
- io_uring transport (separate read/write rings, multishot RECV with provided buffer groups)
- Backpressure handling (explicit `ServerBusy` reject when the input pipeline is full — client should back off and retry)
- Output event channel — real-time broadcast of all execution events to authenticated TCP subscribers via `--event-bind`; per-frame monotonic sequence numbers for gap detection; slow subscriber disconnect

### [Authentication & Authorization](docs/admin-guide.md)
- Ed25519 challenge-response handshake
- Four permission roles: Operator (exchange configuration), Trader (order submission/cancellation), Custodian (deposit/withdraw), ReadOnly (heartbeats)
- Operator API (instrument management and lifecycle, circuit breakers, kill switch, risk limits, fee schedules, end-of-day, live stats dashboard)
- Per-key idempotency (sequence numbers with duplicate rejection — safe to retry on timeout without double-applying)

### [Operations](docs/operations.md)
- Structured logging (`tracing` crate, error-level for server malfunctions only)
- Health/liveness TCP endpoint (`--health-bind`) with Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint (active connections, events processed, journal sequence, replication lag, pipeline health, input queue depth, trading state)
- Admin TUI dashboard (live connection count, events processed, throughput, journal sequence)
- Sparse account storage to reduce memory usage, see [account lifecycle](docs/account-lifecycle.md)

### Testing
- Property-based tests (proptest): price-time priority, balance conservation, volume conservation, reservation consistency, no self-trades under STP, deterministic replay, overflow safety, cancel-replace invariants, fee accounting
- Cross-engine differential testing against independent matching engine implementations and a naive reference oracle (100K+ randomized events)
- Fuzz testing (bolero): journal codec, wire protocol codec
- Crash injection tests: truncation at every byte offset, during snapshot rotation, under realistic load, across multiple rotation cycles
- Multi-process failover tests: SIGKILL primary, promote replica, dual-replication failover, journal catch-up for replacement replicas, verify state consistency and no data loss
- Integration tests: snapshot round-trip, journal replay, shadow stage determinism
