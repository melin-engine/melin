```

- **Single-threaded matching engine** — no locks on the hot path; one thread executes all matching logic
- **LMAX-style disruptor pipeline** ([docs/pipeline-architecture.md](docs/pipeline-architecture.md)) — 3 OS threads (journal, matching, response) on lock-free ring buffers; lock-free CAS-based multi-producer from reader pool; journal and matching run in parallel on the same events
- **Persist-before-ack** — pipelined journal I/O with full durability guarantee; matching latency overlapped against journal writes, acknowledgement gated on confirmed durability, not optimistically sent
- **Batch sync amortization** — under load, one sync covers many events; `pwritev2` with `RWF_DSYNC` (Force Unit Access) combines write + durability in a single syscall; `posix_fallocate` pre-allocates 64 MiB chunks so sync only flushes data pages, not extent metadata
- **Event sourcing** — deterministic replay for crash recovery and audit; snapshots for fast restart; BLAKE3 hash chain for tamper evidence
- **Mechanical sympathy** — cache-line-padded sequences, fixed-point pricing (no floats), pre-allocated buffers with no per-order allocations on the hot path

## Features

Checklist of features expected of a production trade execution engine. Items marked with **[x]** are implemented; **[ ]** are planned.

### Matching Engine ([docs/matching-engine.md](docs/matching-engine.md))
- [x] Strict price-time priority (BTreeMap + VecDeque order book)
- [x] Execution reports: Fill (with fees), Placed, Triggered, Cancelled, Rejected, Replaced
- [x] Multi-instrument exchange with shared account balances

- [ ] Tiered fee schedules (volume-based tiers, account-level overrides)

### Risk & Accounting ([docs/risk-checks.md](docs/risk-checks.md), [docs/balance-management.md](docs/balance-management.md))
- [x] Per-account, per-currency balance management (reserve on order, update on fill, release on cancel)
- [x] Self-trade prevention (per-order modes: CancelNewest, CancelOldest, CancelBoth)
- [x] Fat finger checks (max order size, max notional value — per-instrument configurable `RiskLimits`)
- [x] Kill switch (cancel all resting orders and pending stops for an account across all instruments)
- [x] Client deduplication (per-account OrderId high-water mark — prevents double-execution on crash-recovery retry)
- [x] Price band checks (static lower/upper bounds, per-instrument — part of circuit breaker config)
- [ ] Position/exposure limits
- [ ] Order throttling (per-account rate limiting)

### Event Sourcing & Durability ([docs/journal.md](docs/journal.md))
- [x] Write-ahead journal with CRC32C checksums
- [x] Batch journal I/O via LMAX disruptor ring buffer pipeline
- [x] Pre-allocated storage (`posix_fallocate`) for reduced fsync latency
- [x] Snapshot save/load for fast recovery
- [x] Deterministic replay from journal
- [x] Pipelined io_uring async fsync with group commit
- [x] Journal rotation (automatic snapshot + archive when size threshold exceeded at startup)
- [x] BLAKE3 hash chain with periodic checkpoints (tamper evidence, replica consistency verification)
- [ ] Output event log (durable ExecutionReport stream for audit trail)

### Networking ([docs/wire-protocol.md](docs/wire-protocol.md))
- [x] Custom binary wire protocol (length-prefixed framing)
- [x] TCP transport with `TCP_NODELAY`
- [x] Unix domain socket transport
- [x] Epoll reader pool (edge-triggered, non-blocking) with dedicated I/O threads (zero tokio)
- [x] Lock-free CAS-based multi-producer disruptor (no mutex on input path)
- [x] io_uring transport (separate read/write rings, multishot RECV with provided buffer groups)
- [x] Typed client library
- [x] Terminal UI for interactive testing
- [x] Heartbeats and connection timeouts (bidirectional keepalive, configurable idle timeout detection)
- [ ] Batched io_uring SEND in response stage (reduce per-response syscall overhead)
- [ ] TCP_CORK / MSG_MORE response batching (coalesce small frames into single TCP segments)
- [ ] Backpressure handling (defined policy when disruptor is full)
- [ ] TLS (encrypted client connections)

### Gateway
- [x] TCP proxy between clients and engine (binary protocol)
- [ ] Scalable I/O model (epoll/io_uring multiplexing — current 2-threads-per-client caps at ~500 connections)
- [ ] Output event channel from matching stage (broadcast — prerequisite for market data)
- [ ] Market data dissemination (L2 snapshots, trade feed, BBO push updates)
- [ ] Subscription management (subscribe/unsubscribe per instrument)
- [ ] Reference data management (instrument lifecycle)
- [ ] Rate limiting and connection management (per-client throttling)

### Authentication & Authorization ([docs/admin-guide.md](docs/admin-guide.md))
- [x] Client authentication (Ed25519 challenge-response handshake)
- [ ] Per-account trading permissions
- [x] Admin API (instrument management, deposits, circuit breaker controls, kill switch, risk limits, fee schedules, cancel-replace, live stats dashboard)

### Operations & Reliability ([docs/operations.md](docs/operations.md))
- [x] Structured logging (`tracing` crate, error-level for server malfunctions only)
- [x] Per-stage pipeline latency tracing (`latency-trace` feature gate)
- [x] Configuration management (CLI args for bind address, journal path, core affinity, reader threads)
- [x] Graceful shutdown (SIGINT/SIGTERM handler, ordered drain: readers → journal → matching → response)
- [x] Health checks / readiness probes (`ServerReady` wire handshake on connect)

### Metrics & Observability

Most analytics can run on a **replica** replaying the journal, keeping the primary's hot path free of instrumentation jitter.

#### Primary node (lightweight, operational health)
- [x] Pipeline stage utilization (`pipeline-stats` feature gate — busy/idle ratio per stage)
- [x] Admin TUI observability dashboard (live connection count, events processed, throughput, journal sequence — polled via `QueryStats` through the pipeline)
- [ ] Metrics transport (Prometheus endpoint or stats file — must not touch the hot path)
- [ ] Disruptor queue depth / backpressure monitoring (input ring fill level)
- [ ] Health/liveness endpoint (beyond current `ServerReady` handshake)

#### Replica or offline (journal-derived, zero primary impact)
- [ ] Order/fill/cancel throughput counters (events per second by type)
- [ ] Latency histograms (journal `timestamp_ns` → matching → response, per-event)
- [ ] Volume analytics (traded volume per instrument, per account)
- [ ] Book depth analytics (resting order counts, spread tracking)
- [ ] Audit trail queries (full event history for regulatory compliance)
- [ ] Fee/PnL accounting (when fees and position tracking exist)

### Testing
- [x] `proptest` invariant tests (price-time priority, volume conservation, balance conservation, book/reservation/order-sides consistency, overflow safety, STP enforcement — all order types including stops, all STP modes, circuit breaker toggling, cancel-all)
- [x] Verified `price × quantity` intermediate calculations don't overflow `u64` (use `u128` for computed values)
- [x] Bolero fuzz tests for journal and wire protocol codecs (decode crash discovery + encode/decode round-trip)
- [x] Security audit ([docs/security-audit.md](docs/security-audit.md))

### Redundancy & High Availability
- [ ] Journal replication (WAL streaming to replica; sync for zero data loss, async for lower latency)
- [ ] State machine replication (deterministic replay on replica)
- [ ] Failover detection and promotion (leader election, split-brain prevention)
- [ ] Client failover (reconnect to new primary, resume with sequence numbers)
- [ ] Network partition handling (fencing, quorum-based decisions)

## Priority Roadmap

Ordered by importance for commercial readiness (exchange operators and investors).

1. ~~**Circuit breakers**~~ ✅ — price bands, trading halts. Fully integrated with event sourcing.
2. ~~**Cancel-replace / order amendment**~~ ✅ — atomic price/qty amendment with reservation delta, time priority rules, price-would-cross rejection.
3. **Replication & HA** — journal streaming to a replica, deterministic replay, failover. No exchange runs a single node.
4. ~~**Fuzz testing**~~ ✅ — proptest coverage extended to all order types, STP modes, circuit breakers, stops. Found and fixed a reservation leak on price-improved fills.
5. ~~**Journal rotation + integrity**~~ ✅ — automatic snapshot + journal archiving at startup when size threshold exceeded. BLAKE3 hash chain with periodic checkpoints for tamper evidence and replica consistency. Documented recovery scenarios for every crash timing.
6. ~~**Authentication**~~ ✅ — Ed25519 challenge-response. Admin API for instrument/deposit/risk/circuit-breaker management.
7. ~~**TLS**~~ (deferred) — not needed for VLAN deployments. Ed25519 challenge-response provides identity without encryption overhead on the hot path.
8. **Metrics & observability** — connection counts, queue depth, health endpoints. Operators need visibility.
9. **Auction mechanisms** — opening/closing/volatility auctions. Differentiator for regulated venues.
10. ~~**Fee model**~~ ✅ — per-instrument maker/taker fees in basis points. Deducted from fill proceeds in quote currency. Configurable via admin API, journaled for deterministic replay.
11. ~~**Documentation**~~ ✅ — matching engine, fee model, risk checks, balance management, pipeline architecture, wire protocol, admin guide, operations runbook, benchmarking guide.
12. **Security hardening** — remaining [audit findings](docs/security-audit.md): per-account order limits (SEC-03), order throttling (SEC-04), disk exhaustion handling (SEC-05), snapshot validation (SEC-09).

Also needed: backpressure policy, gateway scalability (epoll/io_uring multiplexing), per-account permissions, crash injection tests (kill server at random points during load, verify recovery produces identical state — validates journal/snapshot/rotation crash safety end-to-end).

### Benchmarking & Measurements ([docs/benchmarking.md](docs/benchmarking.md))
- [x] Realistic order flow generator (power-law prices/sizes, cancels, fills, multiple accounts, STP diversity)
- [x] Multi-threaded io_uring benchmark client (`--bench-threads`)
- [x] JSON output for machine-readable results (`--json`)
- [x] TUI charts: tail latency stability and latency histogram (`--features chart`)
- [x] Dynamic percentile depth based on sample size
- [ ] Saturation curve — sweep `--clients` and `--window`, plot latency vs throughput from JSON output
- [ ] Multi-machine benchmark — run bench from multiple machines simultaneously (`--account-id`, `--order-id-offset`)
- [ ] Real-world data replay (NASDAQ ITCH 5.0, Databento, Lobster — legal review needed)

### Performance Tuning
- [x] Release profile: `lto = "fat"`, `codegen-units = 1`, `panic = "abort"`, `target-cpu=native`
- [x] jemalloc (`tikv-jemallocator`)
- [x] CPU core pinning for all pipeline, reader, and bench threads
- [x] IRQ affinity pinning (`bench-isolate.sh`)
- [x] Kernel boot isolation (`isolcpus`, `nohz_full`, `rcu_nocbs`)
