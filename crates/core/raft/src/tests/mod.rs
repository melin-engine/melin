//! Tests that drive more than one module at once: a three-node election,
//! the RPC transport end to end, and the storage compliance suite. They
//! live inside the crate rather than under `tests/` because what they
//! exercise (the RPC server, the client factory, the file store) is
//! private: the crate's only public surface is what the server runtime
//! needs to start the driver.
